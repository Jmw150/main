# scheme

My lisp of choice because I like things simple. Just first order functions, macros, and 9 primitives. 

Also Chicken scheme compiles to C and I own a copy of its source code. So I don't feel like I am spinning my wheels making something purely for academic enjoyment. I am doing things in a way that is only as complicated as it actually needs to be.
