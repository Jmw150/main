<h2>Homework 5</h2></center>

<b>Due date:</b> Wednesday, October 4, 2017.

<p><b>Ex. 1. a.</b> Download the following files:

<br><a href="./p5/WordCounter.h">WordCounter.h</a>
<br><a href="./p5/WordCounter.cc">WordCounter.cc</a>
<br><a href="./p5/HashTable.h">HashTable.h</a>
<br><a href="./p5/HashTable.cc">HashTable.cc</a>
<br><a href="./p5/porter.h">porter.h</a>
<br><a href="./p5/porter.cc">porter.cc</a>
<br><a href="./p5/main.cc">main.cc</a>
<br><a href="./p5/stopWords">stopWords</a>
<br><a href="./p5/Makefile">Makefile</a>

<p>You can also download the following two files with examples of
using the vector and list classes from the STL:
<br><a href="./p5/list_test.cc">list_test.cc</a>
<br><a href="./p5/vector_test.cc">vector_test.cc</a>

<p>Store the files in a special folder and compile them with the
command "make". The executable created by the command make is called
"hashing".

<p><b>Program description</b>

<p>The program is reading in a list of words terminated by an enter
followed by Ctrl-D (end of file) for Linux, or Ctrl-C on Windows. The
program is performing an indexing of these words using two hash
tables.

<p>The program first reads in a list of common words from the file
<tt>stopWords</tt> and stores them in a hash table called
<tt>stopList</tt>. Note that if you run this on Windows, the program
might have a hard time finding the path to the file "stopWords". It
might work if you place it in the same folder where the executable
(.exe) is.

<p>In the second part, the program inputs from the console the list of
words entered by the user. For each of them, it calls the functions
<tt>toLowerCase</tt> and then <tt>clean</tt> to convert the word to
lowercase and remove all the spaces and punctuation from it.

<p>At this point the program checks if the words are in the list of
common words (the stopList). If they are, they will simply be
discarded. If they are not, then they are processed by the Porter
transformation (function <tt>stripAffixes</tt>) which removes prefixes
and suffixes to keep only the root of the words.

<p>A second table will keep count of the frequency of each particular
root in the text entered by the user. Thus, it will store the root and
the number of times it has encountered it (from the same word or from
different words with the same root). At the end of the input text, the
program displays a statistic of word frequencies.

<p>The program should compile and run but it will give you an empty
output for two reasons. Some functions in the class <tt>HashTable</tt>
have not yet been implemented, and some code needs to be added into
the <tt>main.cc</tt> file.
 
<p><b>b.</b> Complete the implementation of the
class <tt>HashTable</tt> with the 6 functions that don't have a proper
implementation yet. Inside the body of these functions you'll find a
comment saying that the code must be supplied by the student. Read the
comments in front of each function carefully for details about their
implementation.

<p>For the hashing function, you can choose any function you want. I
suggest selecting one of the functions recommended as "good" by the
the notes (chapter 5).

<p><b>c.</b> Complete the function <tt>indexWords</tt> according to
the comment starting with "For the student to add". Implement the
function <tt>increment</tt> in the same file.

<p><b>d. (* 2 extra credit points)</b> Make some experiences with 3
different hashing functions and choose which one is the best. Write a
small paragraph to report the results of your experiences and to
explain your reasons why you think the function you chose is the best
one.
