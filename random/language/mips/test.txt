conjecture: Let a and b be positive integers such that ab+1  | a^2 + b^2, then (a^2+b^2)/(ab+1) is a square number.


When a = 1 and b = 1, then 2/2 = 1 which is a square of 1. Aside form this case a = b would lead to 2a^2/(a^2+1) which is not divisible as gcd(n,n+1) = 1. So since both equations are commutative at ab and a^2+b^2 and not equal, I can pick a > b, and just redo the proof for b > a, and it will have the same structure. 

If ab+1 | a^2 + b^2, then (a^2 + b^2)/(ab+1) = n for some integer n.

(1) a^2 + b^2 - abn - n = 0 
a^2 - (bn)a + (b^2 - n) = 0 

So results 

a = (-bn +- ((bn)^2 - 4(b^2-n))^{1/2})/2
