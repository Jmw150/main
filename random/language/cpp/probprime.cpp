/*
This function tests whether it is likely that n is prime. It does this by
testing k positive integers a to determine whether they satisfy the
equation a^(n-1) mod n = 1 of Fermatâ€™s Little Theorem. The boolean value
returned by the function may be incorrect. If k is large, the probability
of an incorrect answer is extremely small.
