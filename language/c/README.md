# C

C has to be my favorite language in what it stands for and can do. It is a very
simple language. Even within the language standard, it is not required to pay in
bytes for all of its features. It has the largest resume in actual portability.
It talks to the computer pretty much directly. And with a bit of cleverness it
can be made to do things modern languages often do: garbage collection, memory
safty, oop, etc..

It is a language that gets me past being concerned about the language or
library I am using. Kind of wish functions where first class though...
