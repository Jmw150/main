Dear fellow chicken schemers,

the following steps should suffice to upgrade to the latest version
of octave:

1. Get the latest source from
   http://carretechnologies.com/scheme/octave/octave.html
2. Adjust the list of exported symbols in octave-chicken.scm
3. If necessary adjust import / use statements in the octave-chicken
   wrapper
4. compile and install

Have fun!
