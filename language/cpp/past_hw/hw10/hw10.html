<h2>C243 Homework 10</h2></center>

<b>Due date:</b> Monday, November 27, 2017.

<p><b>Ex. 1.</b> Download the following files:
<br><a href="./p10/graph.h">graph.h</a>
<br><a href="./p10/graph.cc">graph.cc</a>
<br><a href="./p10/main.cc">main.cc</a>
<br><a href="./p10/Makefile">Makefile</a>
<br><a href="./p10/graph1.txt">graph1.txt</a>
<br><a href="./p10/graph2.txt">graph2.txt</a>
<br><a href="./p10/graph3.txt">graph3.txt</a>
<br><a href="./p10/graph4.txt">graph4.txt</a>
<br><a href="./p10/graph5.txt">graph5.txt</a>

<p>They compile with the command <tt>make</tt> and the program can be
executed with the command <tt>graph</tt>. The text files contain
examples of graphs that can be read by the program.

<p>You will have to implement the 3 functions that have their body
missing at the end of the <tt>graph.cc</tt> file and make some
modifications to <tt>main.cc</tt>. A fourth one can be implemented for
extra credit.

<p><b>a. &nbsp; <tt>write</tt></b> . This function should write the
graph to a file according to the format described in class and in the
notes. You have to make sure that the file is compatible with the read
function - meaning that you should be able to read the graph back from
the file. You also have to be careful not to write each edge twice if
the graph is undirected.

<p><b>b. &nbsp; <tt>input</tt></b> . This function should ask the user
if the graph is directed or not, and then for the number of nodes in
the graph. After inputting this information, you will need to set
the <tt>directed</tt> flag appropritely and then initialize the graph
with that number of vertices, which will assign the names as uppercase
letters in sequence. Don't ask the user for the names of the verices,
but give them a warning about the way the names were assigned. Then it
should input edges in the form first name second name. The input
should end with anything that is not an uppercase letter.

<p><b>c. &nbsp; <tt>printBf</tt> &nbsp; or
&nbsp; <tt>printDf</tt></b>. Choose one of these two functions to
implement, and let me know in a comment in the submission which one
you've chosen. These functions should implement the breadth-first and
depth-first traversal of the graph. The operation given in pseudo-code
as "processing a node" consists in this case of writing out the name
of the vertex. For the <tt>printBf</tt> you'll need a queue class. You
can use either the class from homework 3, of the STL class queue (see
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/queue/">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/queue/</a>
for a reference).

<p><b>Optional</b> (3 extra credit points): implement both the
breadth-first and the depth-first traversal functions above.

<p><b>d.</b> Modify the menu functions in <tt>main.cc</tt> by adding
the options of writing the graph to a file or to input it from the
user.

<p><b>Turn in:</b> All the files that you modify.
